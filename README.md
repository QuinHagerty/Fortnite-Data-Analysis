# Python-CL-Sep-2018-Mon
My Python data analysis project for Code Louisville

Start up:
1. Clone and download files from GitHub
2. Open Duos_beta.ipynb in jupyter notebooks through Anocanda.
3. Run all of the cells

This project was inspired by my love of competitive gaming and drive to keep improving my skill.

I am pulling my friends player data from Fortnite so I can see if he has been playing better week to week. I also want to look day to day within those weeks to see if he played better on a specific day and which day he plays the least.

Under each section is a description of what the code is doing.
