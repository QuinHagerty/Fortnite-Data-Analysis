# Python-CL-Sep-2018-Mon
My Python data analysis project for Code Louisville

I am pulling my friends player data from Fortnite so see is he has been playing better week to week. I also want to look day to day within those weeks to see if he played better on a specific day or maybe based on number of games played that day. does he get better the more games played or does he tire out and start to do worse? maybe I can find the ideal day and number of games.

First I got an API key from TRN a fortnite tracking website. I used that with his account ID to pull his recent data.
